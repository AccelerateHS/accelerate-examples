==============

Implementation of a simple [ray tracer][ray-tracing-wiki] in Accelerate. The
program supports multiple reflections, but is otherwise quite basic. This
simplicity however means the GUI program can be interactive; use the WASD keys
to move the view port around, and the arrow keys to move the position of the
light source.
