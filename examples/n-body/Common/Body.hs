-- Acceleration ----------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- | Calculate the acceleration on a point due to some other point as an inverse
--   separation-squared relation. The force on a body i caused by its
--   gravitational attraction to a body j is given by:
--
--                m_i m_j     r_ij
--      f_ij = G --------- . ------
--                |r_ij|^2   |r_ij|
--
--   The total force on a body F is given by this interaction to all other
--   bodies:
--
--      F_i = Sum_{i/=j} f_ij
--
--                               m_j r_ij
--          = G m_i . Sum_{j/=i} --------
--                                |r_ij|^3
--
--   As the bodies approach each other, the force between them grows without
--   bound, which is an undesirable situation for numerical integration. Since
--   collisions between bodies are precluded, a softening factor (epsilon^2 > 0)
--   is added:
--
--                                  m_j r_ij
--      F_i = G m_i . Sum -----------------------------
--                        ( |r_ij|^2 + epsilon^2) ^ 3/2
--
--   Note that the condition (i /= j) is no longer required, because (f_ii = 0)
--   when (epsilon^2 > 0). The softening factor models the interaction between
--   two Plummer point masses: bodies that behave as if they were spherical
--   galaxies (and thus may pass through each other).
--
--   To integrate over time, we need the acceleration (a_i = F_i / m_i), and so
--   the above can be simplified by removing m_i from the RHS. This function
--   computes the component of the Sum for two bodies i and j.
